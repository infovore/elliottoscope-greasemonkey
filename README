==========================

Schooloscope (www.schooloscope.com) tells you how your school's doing.

Elliotoscope (http://wiki.musichackday.org/index.php?title=Elliotoscope) uses Wikipedia to tell you about famous people who came from a school.

This Greasemonkey script displays results from the latter on the former.
